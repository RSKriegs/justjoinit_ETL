This is a branch for a development of an updated and reworked version of original script.
The new script will intend to scrap a subset of data from justjoin.it and save it locally, excluding original cloud data load layer.
This is originally intended to be used for my own purposes only, but feel free to fork & contribute to the future.

TODO:
- MUST HAVE: develop a web scraper with Selenium and beautifulsoup4 from justjoin.it to extract offers data.
- MUST HAVE: run, test and make sure that the frontend structure of a website doesn't change overtime.
- MUST HAVE: rework a data model.
- optional: optimize transformations.
- optional: modularize code.
- optional: write CI & automated tests.
- optional: Dockerize script.
- optional: cloud deployment.
